# Data-for-Good-JP-Morgan-Hackathon
The Data for Good virtual hackathon gave us the chance to use our data analysis and coding skills to help a nonprofit organization further their mission. It's also a great opportunity to gain insight into how JPMorgan Chase leverages Artificial Intelligence (Al), Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science to drive innovation and serve the clients.

Within 7 hours, our team of 4 worked on the Public N.Y.C Schools data and proposed actionable recommendations based on our analyses.
